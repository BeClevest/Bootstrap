This is good for having two bars (Navbar and secon statues bar) at top and FIXEd

<div class="row" id="stat-bar"></div>

- Ass the script to your js

$('#stat-bar').affix({
  offset: {top: 50}
});


- May also need new css Rule (Div may break in half) as:

.affix{
    left: 0px !important;
    right: 0px !important;
}
